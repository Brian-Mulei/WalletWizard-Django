# WalletWizard-Django

This is a project build using Django Framework.

It is the back end for my mobile app [Walllet Wizard](https://github.com/Brian-Mulei/walletwizard) that users use to keep track of their finances.

The project uses Django Rest Framework to implement APIs.

The relational Database used is PostgreSQL
